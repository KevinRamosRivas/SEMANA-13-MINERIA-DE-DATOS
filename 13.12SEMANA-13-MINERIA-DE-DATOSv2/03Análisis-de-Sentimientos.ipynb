She sees a psychic vision of his bullies whom she attempts to kill in revenge but gets expelled. Her parents,\\xa0Morticia\\xa0and\\xa0Gomez, decide to enroll her in Nevermore Academy, a school for outcasts. Meanwhile, a hiker is killed by an unknown creature near Nevermore. Wednesday’s parents release\\xa0Thing, a sentient disembodied hand, to watch over her. She meets her roommate Enid, her complete opposite, and duels with Bianca, the popular girl, after she bullies another boy, Rowan. Later, Wednesday is nearly killed by a falling gargoyle but is saved by Bianca’s ex-boyfriend Xavier. After escaping her court-ordered therapy session, Wednesday meets Tyler, who agrees to help her escape from Nevermore. However, she is apprehended by principal Larissa Weems and taken back to the school. Later, Tyler and Wednesday meet at the local fair, and Wednesday has a vision of Rowan’s death. Rowan attempts to kill her but is murdered by the monster. * * * [jauntily macabre music playing] [student laughing] [heavy footfalls echoing] [girl] I’m not sure whose twisted idea it was to put hundreds of adolescents in underfunded schools run by people whose dreams were crushed years ago… but I admire the sadism.

Maybe you’ll even make some friends. Nevermore is like no other boarding school. It’s a magical place. It’s where I met your mother. And we fell in love. [yearning sigh] You guys are making me nauseous. Not in a good way. Darling, we aren’t the ones who got you expelled. That boy’s family was going to file attempted murder charges. How would that have looked on your record? Terrible. Everyone would know I failed to get the job done. Hmm. [man] Just over here is fine. Thanks. You sure you want to get out here? The trail might look pretty, but it runs right past Nevermore. That school for outcasts? Huh. That’s a polite way of putting it. I never had a problem with outcasts. My counselor at summer camp was a werewolf. Great guy. Yeah, they’re just like you and me, until they rip your throat out. [chuckles wryly] Thanks. [bird caws] [low, menacing music playing] [branches snapping] [ragged breathing] [creature snarls] [panicked screaming] [gate hinges creak] [ominous music builds] [sighs] At least it’s turning into a beautiful day. [bells tolling] [thunder rumbling] [playfully gloomy music playing] Wednesday is certainly a unique name. I’m guessing it was the day you were born? I was born on Friday the 13th. Her name comes from a line from my favorite nursery rhyme, “Wednesday’s child is full of woe.” You always had a unique perspective on the world, Morticia. Hmm. Did your mother tell you we were roommates back in the day? And you graduated with your sanity intact? Impressive. You’ve certainly had a very interesting educational journey. Eight schools in five years. They haven’t built one strong enough to hold me. I bet this place won’t be any different. What our daughter is trying to say is that she greatly appreciates the opportunity. Nevermore doesn’t usually accept students mid-term, but given Wednesday’s perfect grades and your family’s long history with the school, I’ve spoken with the board and we’ve made an exception. [quirky music playing] Larissa, what about Wednesday’s, um… therapy sessions? The court ordered them. Hmm. The school has a relationship with a therapist in Jericho. She can meet twice a week. Did you hear that, my little storm cloud? You’re in excellent hands. We’ll see if she survives the first session. I’ve assigned you to your mother’s old dorm. Ophelia Hall. [gasps, chuckles excitedly] [Wednesday] Refresh my memory. Ophelia’s the one who kills herself after being driven mad by her family, correct? Should we go meet your new roommate? [Morticia gasps] It’s so… vivid. [inhales excitedly] Howdy, roomie. Wednesday, this is Enid Sinclair. Are you feeling okay? You look a little pale. Wednesday always looks half-dead. Oh. Welcome to Ophelia Hall. Not a hugger. Got it. Please excuse Wednesday. She’s allergic to color. [Enid] Oh, wow. What happens to you? [flatly] I break out into hives and then the flesh peels off my bones. Luckily, we’ve special ordered you a uniform.

              "  'ng] [haunting choral vocalizations] Nevermore was founded in 1791 to educate people like us. Outcasts, freaks, monsters, fill in your favorite marginalized group here. You can save the sanitized sales pitch. I don’t plan on staying here for long. Why not? This was my parents’ idea. Oh look, there’s my mother smirking at me. They’ve been looking for any excuse to send me here. It’s all a part of their nefarious, yet completely obvious plan. What plan? To turn me into a version of themselves. In that case, perhaps you can clear something up. Rumor’s been swirling around that you killed a kid at your old school, and your parents pulled strings to get you off. Actually, it was two kids, but who’s counting? Welcome to the quad. It’s a pentagon. The whole snarky Goth girl thing might have worked at normie school, but here things are different. Let me give you a wiki on Nevermore’s social scene. I’m not interested in participating in tribal adolescent clichés. Well, then use it to fill your obviously bottomless pit of disdain. There are many flavors of outcasts here, but the four main cliques are Fangs, Furs, Stoners and Scales. Those are the Fangs, AKA vampires. Some of them have literally been here for decades. That bunch of knuckleheads are Furs, AKA werewolves. Like me! [Furs howling] Full moons get pretty loud around here. That’s when Furs wolf out. I suggest you pick up noise-cancelling headphones. I’m assuming Scales are sirens? [Enid] You catch on quick. And that girl, Bianca Barclay, is the closest thing Nevermore has to royalty. [enchanting whooshing] Although her crown’s been slipping lately. She used to date our resident tortured artist, Xavier Thorpe. But they broke up at the beginning of the semester. Reason unknown. Fascinating. I know, right? My vlog is, like, the number one source for Nevermore gossip. Yo, Enid! You’re not gonna believe the dirt I heard about your new roommate. She eats human flesh. Chowed down on that kid she murdered. You better watch your back. Quite the contrary. I actually fillet the bodies of my victims, then feed them to my menagerie of pets. Ajax, this is my new roommate, Wednesday. Whoa. You’re in black and white. Like a living Instagram filter. Ignore him. Gorgons spend way too much time getting stoned. He’s cute, but clueless. It’s a small school. There wasn’t much online about you. You should really get on\\xa0Insta, Snapchat and TikTok. I find social media to be a soul-sucking void of meaningless affirmation. Look at you, my little deathtrap. Seeing you in this uniform brings back so many terrible memories. Doesn’t it, Tish? Yes. Why don’t you boys wait in the car? Wednesday and I need a moment. [Pugsley grunts] Pugsley, you’re soft and weak. You’ll never survive without me. I give you two months, tops. I’m gonna miss you, too, sis. Any plans you have of running away end right now. I’ve alerted all family members to contact me the minute you darken their doorstep. You have nowhere to go. As usual, you underestimate me, Mother. I will escape this educational penitentiary, and you will never hear from me again. [sighs] You are a brilliant girl, Wednesday, but sometimes you get in your own way. I’m sure you’ll grow to love Nevermore, and find it as life-c',\n",
              "  'hanging as I did. Oh, I got you a little something. W… M. Our initials. It’s made of obsidian, which Aztec priests used to conjure visions. It’s a symbol of our connection. Which one of your spirits suggested this toe-curling tchotchke? I’m not you, Mother. I will never fall in love, or be a housewife, or have a family. I’m told girls your age say hurtful things, and I shouldn’t take it to heart. Fortunately, you don’t have one. Finally, a kind word for your mother. Lurch, the crystal ball, please. We can’t talk to you for the first week while you’re settling in, so we’ll call you next Sunday. [delicate, emotional music playing] [car door closes] Don’t worry, my love. Our little scorpion won’t be alone. [undercarriage clattering] [fingers scuttling] [thunder booms] Where’s the rest of him? Well, the torso and arm are over there. We found a leg by the lake. There’s an arm in that tree over there, and the rest of the parts are so far unaccounted for. It matches the profile of the other two attacks last week. All right, issue a warning. Keep hikers out of the woods. Don’t approve any more campfire permits for the foreseeable future. What do you want me to tell the press? You know they’re going to be swarming like mosquitos in July. Tell them the bear is back. You don’t believe that, Sheriff. No, I don’t. Whatever did this wasn’t human. Look, I know these murders are connected to Nevermore. I just can’t prove it yet. So until I can… it’s a goddamn bear. What the hell did you do to my room? Dividing our room equally. It looks like a rainbow vomited on your side. I… Silence would be appreciated. This is my writing time. Your writing time? I devote an hour a day to my novel. Perhaps if you did the same, your vlog might be coherent. I’ve read serial killer diaries with better punctuation. I write in my voice. It’s my truth. It’s what my followers love. Your followers are clearly imbeciles. They respond to your stories with insipid little pictures. Uh, you mean, emojis? It’s how people express their feelings. I realize that’s a foreign concept to you. When I look at you, the following emojis come to mind. Rope, shovel, hole. By the way, there are two D’s in Addams. If you’re going to gossip about me, at least spell my name correctly. [music player beeps, playing peppy pop song] Turn that off. This is your final warning. [playfully] Rawr! Don’t mess with me. This kitty’s got claws, and I’m not afraid to use them. [door opens] Good evening, girls. Oh, sorry about the mud. I wanted to make sure that Wednesday was settling in. Ah. Is this a bad time? I’m Ms. Thornhill, your dorm mom. Apologies, I wasn’t here to greet you when you arrived. I trust Enid has given you the old Nevermore welcome. She’s been smothering me with hospitality. I hope to return the favor. In her sleep. Well, here’s a little welcome gift from my conservatory. I try to match the right flower to each of my girls. When I read your personal statement in your application, I immediately thought of this one. The black dahlia. Oh, you know it? Of course. It’s named after my favorite unsolved murder. Thank you. Okey-dokey. Before I leave, I want to go over a few house rules. Lights off at 10:00, no loud music, and no boys, ever. What’s t',\n",

The locals are a tad bit wary about Nevermore, so please don’t go making any waves, or perpetuating any outcast stereotypes. That means keep your claws to yourself, and no smothering people in their sleep. Are we clear? Great talk. [chuckles] [door opens] [foils clattering] [fencer grunts] [fencer grunts] Coach, Coach, she tripped me. It was a clean strike, Rowan. Maybe if you whined less and practiced more, you wouldn’t suck. Seriously, Coach, when am I gonna get real competition? Anyone else want to challenge me? I do. [ominous music playing] Oh, you must be the psychopath they let in. You must be the self-appointed Queen Bee. Interesting thing about bees. Pull out their stingers, they drop dead. [fencers] Ooh! Rowan doesn’t need you to come to his defense. He’s not helpless, he’s lazy. Are we doing this or not? En garde. [dramatic music playing] [both grunting] [coach] Point to Wednesday. [both continue grunting] [coach] The score is even. That first point was clearly beginner’s luck. Let’s finish this. For the final point, I would like to invoke a military challenge. No masks. No tips. [fencers] Ooh. Winner draws first blood. [dramatic musical flourish] It’s your decision, Bianca. Let’s see if you bleed in black and white. [dramatic music continues] [rapier tip slices] [disbelieving exhale] Your face finally got that splash of color it so desperately needed. [chuckles] [Rowan] You’re Wednesday, right? Rowan. I know how you feel. I guarantee you don’t. My mother promised me I’d finally fit in somewhere. I never thought it was possible to be an outcast in a school full of outcasts. But it looks like you’re gonna give me a run for my money. Uh… Sorry about the… nick. No good deed goes unpunished. [quirkily sinister music playing] [water tank gurgling] [chilling choir vocalizations] [stone scraping] [boy] Wednesday! Welcome back. Just take it easy. Nurse said you don’t have a concussion, but you probably have a nasty bump, huh? The last thing I remember I was walking outside feeling a mixture of rage, pity and self-disgust. I never felt that way before. Losing to Bianca has that effect on people, I think. Then I looked up and saw that gargoyle coming down and I thought, “At least I’ll have an imaginative death.” Then you tackled me out of the way. Why? [clicks tongue] Call it instinct. So you were guided by latent chivalry, the tool of the patriarchy, to extract my undying gratitude? Mm-hmm. Most people just say thank you. I didn’t want to be rescued. I shoulda just let that thing smash you to mush? I would have rather saved myself. [scoffs] Good to see you haven’t changed. If makes you feel any better, let’s just say I returned the favor. Xavier Thorpe? You probably don’t remember me. Last time we met, I was about two feet shorter, 40 pounds heavier. What happened? [exhales] Puberty, I guess. What happened the last time we met? Oh.

A sanctuary where we can discuss anything. What you’re thinking, feeling, your views on the world, personal philosophy. That’s easy. I think that this is a waste of time. I see the world as a place that must be endured, and my personal philosophy is kill or be killed. So, for instance, when someone bullies your brother, your response is to dump piranha in the pool. You know the old saying, never bring a knife to a sword fight. Unless it’s concealed. Point is, you assaulted a boy, and showed no remorse for your actions. That’s why you’re here.

Everything said in these sessions is strictly confidential. Do your plans involve becoming an author? I understand you’ve written three novels about a teen girl detective, Viper De La Muerte. Can you tell me about her? Viper is smart, perceptive, chronically misunderstood. Any luck getting your work published? Editors are short-sighted, fear-based life forms. One once described my writing as gratuitously morbid, and suggested I seek psychiatric help. [Kinbott] Hmm. Ironic, isn’t it? How did you take that? I sent her a “thank you.” [mischievous music playing] [screams] I’ve always been open to constructive criticism. I’m glad to hear that. Because I was sent the manuscripts as part of your psych evaluation. The relationship I found most intriguing was that of Viper and her mother, Dominica. Why don’t we dig into that?

It’s four shots of espresso. Yeah, I… I know what a quad is, but, spoiler alert, the espresso machine’s having a seizure, so all we have is drip. But drip is for people who hate themselves and know their lives have no real purpose or meaning. What’s wrong with your machine? It’s a temperamental beast with a mind of its own, and it doesn’t help that the instructions are in Italian. I need a tri-wing screwdriver and a four-millimeter Allen wrench. Wait, you read Italian? Of course. It’s the native tongue of Machiavelli. Here’s the deal. I’m going to fix your coffee machine, then you’re going to make my coffee and call a taxi. Uh, no taxis in Jericho. Try Uber?

My mom says some wolves are late bloomers, but I’ve been to the best Lycanologist. I had to fly to Milwaukee, would you believe it? Yeah, she says there’s a chance I may never… you know. What happens then? I’d become a lone wolf. Sounds perfect. Are you kidding me? My life would be officially over. I’d be kicked out of my family pack with no prospect of finding a mate.

They wondered what kind of freak would have a scorpion for a pet. [boy] Yeah. Two of them held me down and made me watch… [bullies laughing] [gasps] [Nero squelching] …while the others ran Nero over until… [forlorn music playing] It was snowing when I buried what was left of him.

[gloomy, bombastic music plays] How could you miss a dead body? ‘Cause it wasn’t there. No footprints, no blood, no sign of a struggle. Nothing, nada. My search party looked all night. Well, your search party must have left their seeing-eye dogs at home. I saw that monster kill Rowan right in front of me. Get a good look at this monster thing? It didn’t stick around for a chat. Maybe it was one of your classmates. Sheriff, I find that question offensive. I don’t care, ’cause I got three other dead bodies in the morgue. Hikers just ripped apart in the woods. The mayor said those were bear attacks. Well, the mayor and I disagree on that. So you automatically assume a Nevermore student is the murderer, even though there’s no evidence a crime was even committed. I’m sorry. I forgot, you only teach the good outcasts here, right? [Weems sighs] My guess is Rowan ran away. State troopers have put out an alert, and I’ve contacted his family, but they haven’t heard from him either. Dead people are notoriously bad at returning calls. What were you doing out in the woods with him, Ms. Addams? I heard a noise in the forest and went to go investigate. That’s when I stumbled upon the attack. Then what happened? Then I ran into Bianca Barclay, and I told her to go for help. Next thing I remember, I was awaking in my dorm.

He’s… It started to freak me out. So what’s the deal with you and Tyler? I’m sorry, were you the only one who got to ask non-archery questions? There is no deal. He was doing me a favor driving me out of town. Yeah, word of advice. Steer clear. Why? Because he’s a normie? Tyler and his friends are jerks. They can’t stand that this school’s propping up their Podunk town. Says the boy whose life was served on a silver platter. Hey, girls in glass houses… Should throw bigger stones. At least I’m not an elitist snob. [bow string draws taut] [plucky musical flourish] Ouch. [bees buzzing] Are you interested in the ancient art of beekeeping? [beekeeper chuckles] Eugene.

Fun fact, it’s also one of the few ecosystems in which females dominate. From the queen bee to her workers. There’s no patriarchy in the hive! [curious, quirky music plays] [sighs] [Wednesday] Rowan! We need to talk. Wednesday, I’m not allowed to speak to anyone. You had a lot to say when you tried to kill me. Told me I was destined to destroy the school, remember? Where did you get that drawing? I just went into the woods to clear my head. Then you came after me. Wednesday. You shouldn’t be here. Yeah, back off and leave me alone.

[thwack] [students laugh] Wednesday, we’re thrilled to have you join us on our journey into the world of carnivorous plants. Now… who can tell us the name of this beauty? Dendrophylax lindenii. Otherwise known as the ghost orchid. First discovered on the Isle of Wight in 1854. Very good, Wednesday. You may have competition for first chair, Bianca. [student] Ooh! [subdued snickers] Wednesday, perhaps you can identify the ghost orchid’s greatest qualities. Resilience and adaptability. It’s able to thrive in even the most hostile environments. But its mere presence can change the ecosystem, causing the established plants to reject it. Usually because the native species is allowed to thrive unchecked. Nothing a Weedwacker couldn’t fix. You can most certainly try. Are we still talking about flowers? [students chuckle] Thank you, ladies, for those illuminating insights. Clearly the plants aren’t the only carnivores in class today.

I’m busy and bees totally creep me out. Why don’t you ask Thing? Wait, you can’t because he’s mad at you. Why’s he mad? He’s the one who screwed up. All I know is that we spent an hour giving each other manis, and he really opened up. He feels like you don’t respect him as a person. Technically, he’s only a hand. Wednesday! He’s your family. And he would\\xa0do anything for you. Go apologize and I’ll reconsider helping you. [pages rustling] I snapped at you. I’ll check my tone in the future. Now chop-chop, before all our leads turn cold. What is it that you want? Hand cream? Nail buffer? New cuticle scissors? Consider it done. [tapping] [Wednesday sighs] I know I’m stubborn, single-minded and obsessive. But those are all traits of great writers. Yes. And serial killers. What’s your point? I have nothing to get off my chest, and I am not submitting to your emotional blackmail. [tapping] Fine. When Rowan showed me this, it confirmed my greatest fear. That I’m going to be responsible for something terrible. Not good terrible, like Ivan. Bad terrible. And I can’t let that happen. That’s why I need to find out the truth. Breathe a word of this to anyone and I will end you.

You must think it’s weird I’m stalking him. No, I consistently stalk my parents. Hey, wait, what really happened the other night at the festival? Look, I swear I won’t say anything to my dad. I thought Rowan was in danger. Turns out I was wrong. Then he proceeded to use his telekinesis to try and choke me to death. Holy shit. Wh… Why would he do that? No idea. That’s when this monster came out of the shadows and gutted him. Whoa. Whoa. So… So you really saw it? And it didn’t try to kill you? It actually saved me from Rowan. That’s the part I’m trying to figure out. I came here to find something that can prove he was murdered and that I haven’t lost my mind. Yet. [ominous music playing] These are Rowan’s. I knew it was a cover-up. [eerie whooshing] [Rowan] What are you talking about? So much of my… …my new desk, you psychopath! [Xavier echoing] Speaking of that… You creep people out! You know… Unbelievable. I did. You’re crazy! [grunts] You okay? [Wednesday] I keep seeing that same purple book. The cover was darker. More like a day-old contusion. Keep looking. I don’t usually find students in here looking for actual books. [chuckles] Most sneak in to make out. I accidentally walked in on two vampires\\xa0fanging. I can’t unsee that. Is there something I can help you find? Have you seen this before? It’s a watermark from a book I’m looking for. I think it’s the symbol to an old student society. Um… The Nightshades.

Would it kill you to not think the worst of me for once? [Xavier] What do you want, Bianca? To see how you’re doing. I’m sorry about Rowan. I know you guys used to be close. Since when did you give a damn about Rowan? You were the one afraid he’d do something to Wednesday. Isn’t that why you’ve been following her like an eager-eyed puppy? Or is there something more? Seriously, what do you see in her? You have a thing for a tragic goth girls with funeral-parlor fashion sense? Maybe it’s because she hasn’t tried to manipulate me. I make one mistake, and you can’t forgive me. She treats you like crap, you can’t get enough. Why are you fixated on Wednesday? Because she thinks she’s better than everyone else. I can’t wait to crush Ophelia Hall tomorrow and watch her werewolf roommate crumble. It’s gonna be a Poe Cup finale to remember. I hate to think what you’ve got planned. My game’s already started. I like to win. Is that so wrong? And you wonder why I broke up with you. You used to love my killer instinct. We were good together, Xavier. Were we? Is that just how you wanted me to feel? Trust me, Wednesday Addams is not the girl of your dreams. She’s the stuff of your nightmares. [door opens] [Enid weeping] Where have you been? I’m literally having a heart attack right now.

But I will get the last laugh. Your penchant for riddles was legendary. And this might be your cleverest yet. Because it’s not a single riddle. Rather, each line is its own separate one. “The opposite of moon.” Sun. “A world between ours.” Nether. “Two months before June.” April. “A self-seeding flower.” Pansy. “One more than one.” Two. “Its leaves weep to the ground.” Willow. “It melts in the sun.” Ice. “Its beginning and end never found.” Circle. “Every rule has one.” Exception. “The answer will give a sharp cracking sound.” [music builds to climax] [sharp cracking sound] [grand music playing] Secret societies.

A drawing in the book leads her to an exhibition at a local fair, where she notices the painting of a girl she had seen in her visions. In the forest, Wednesday envisions the girl—believed to be an old ancestor of hers—ready to be executed by Joseph Crackstone, the town’s forefather intent on killing all misfits, but she is able to escape. Wednesday is ambushed by the monster, which she discovers to be human. Back in town, Wednesday crashes the ceremony and is scolded by Weems.

I’m not sure what secret Crackstone is hiding, but I have a strange feeling the answers to my future lie in the past. The Old Meeting House, 1625. Thing, this is the girl from my vision. She’s even holding the same book. That black one she had outside Crackstone’s crypt. [dramatic music playing] How now. Your Nevermore sister, the one with the dark eyes and the sour face, where has she hithered? You mean Wednesday Addams? Knowing her, she’s hithered somewhere she shan’t be. This is the book! Codex Umbrarum. That’s Latin for “Book of Shadows.” Great. It’s a fake. I don’t know who Etsy is, but I doubt she was an outcast settler. [door opens] [grunts] Just what the fudge are you doing in here, missy? Mistress Arlene. How now? How now, indeed. I proclaimed the meeting house is under repair. I know thoust heard me. I told her the door was unlocked and you were dying to learn more about Crackstone. Yes, and this display case was already open. That book’s a replica. You don’t say.

[quizzical music playing] Can I help you? [door opens, bell chimes] Ooh. That gives me the heebie-jeebies. [Ajax] I don’t know. You think squirrels and rats could ever work out? I mean, they’re two totally different species. Oh, yeah. I mean, totally. Why not? They have more in common than you think. Most people are scared of them, so it would just be us… them… against the world. Wow. [chuckles] That was… deep. You know, by the way, I totally dug the way you scratched out the bottom of our boat at Poe Cup. It was pretty badass. Thanks. You’re not mad you lost? I was just doing a solid for Xavier. I mean, he’s my boy, but he’s super competitive. Seems so laid-back. Bro’s got a darker side most people don’t see. I think it’s because his dad is… well, you know, famous. All that pressure. You realize this is, like, the longest conversation we’ve ever had? [heart-warming music playing] Gorgons are taught not to engage. You know, I don’t want to accidentally stone someone. I’m not afraid of being stoned by you. It’s just temporary. Really? You mean that? One hundo! So, um, I was thinking of sneaking behind the greenhouse tonight. Supposed to be a blue moon. Only happens once every 23 years or something crazy. Should get a killer view from there. Cool. Hey, have fun. You know that’s where a lot of kids go to hook up, right? I mean, it could get awkward. Ajax! I just spent all morning flirting and hinting and trying to act cute while brushing some roadkill just so you would ask me on a date. Oh! [laughs] Oh! That’s what you were doing. I kind of wondered when you spent so long brushing that opossum’s tail. [both chuckle] Hey, so you want to meet up behind the greenhouse tonight? Yes. Yes, I do. [proprietor] Ajax, can you help me move the badger dentist to the front window? Yes! I can’t believe he asked. [plucky, excited music playing] I thought you were supposed to be at Pilgrim World. I deserted it while my sanity was still intact. Oh yeah? You want a coffee? It’s one of the many perks of this wonderful assignment. I’m actually here for Tyler. I told you he was bad news. Twice. But who I speak to is my business. [bell dings] You rang? [scoffs] Want the usual? And some help. You know the original pilgrim meeting house, the one from the 1600s? You know if it’s still around?

Hey, listen, the ruins are kind of tricky to find. I could take you this afternoon. My shift ends at 2:00. Principal Weems would hang, draw and quarter me if I miss the big statue dedication. And as enticing as that sounds, I’d prefer to keep a low profile. Besides, I know my way around the great outdoors. Don’t tell me you were a Girl Scout. I could eat Girl Scouts for breakfast. I have an uncle who went to prison for that. [whimsically morbid music playing] [birds cawing] I was expecting more too. Who you talking to, little girl?

I was following the monster. You saw it? It’s here? Do you have a death wish or something? What are you doing here? I overheard you say you were checking out the old meeting house. It’s lucky I showed up when I did. I did learn one thing. The monster is human. Its tracks turned from monster prints to human ones. Show me. The rain washed them all away. [Xavier scoffs] I know what I saw. I’m trying to keep an open mind. How big of you. I do think you might be right about Rowan. [suspicious music playing] Why the sudden change of heart? I texted him again today. I said maybe we could meet over spring break and go snowboarding like we did last year. This time he texted right back, said he wouldn’t be able to make it. Only you never went snowboarding last year. Part of me wanted to blame his recent weirdness. I didn’t want to think something bad had happened. The cover-up is always worse than the crime. Now I need you to be honest with me. Why’d you come out to the old meeting house in the first place? I was trying to learn more about Crackstone. Figure out how he’s connected to this. Yeah, you were trying to use your psychic abilities, right? What makes you think I have any? Lucky guess. When did they start? About a year ago. When they\\xa0happen, it feels like I’m touching live wire. I usually enjoy that sensation. Yeah, but you can’t control it and that freaks you out. My dad’s a psychic. Vincent Thorpe. My brother’s his number one fan. Watched his Vegas Special so many times I’m surprised it’s not imprinted on his eyeballs. So I’ve lived with a self-described master. The first thing he’ll tell you is that visions can’t be trusted. They only show one part of the picture. I saw Joseph Crackstone in front of me as clearly as I’m seeing you now. He gathered all the outcasts in the meeting house and burned them alive. Okay, he was a sadistic asshole. It was 400 years ago. It’s got nothing to do with now. But what if it does? You saw Rowan’s drawing. Crackstone was standing in the quad. You’re creating a story in your head and using vi',\n",

All I’m saying is my dad, the expert, would warn you that psychic ability isn’t rooted in logic. It’s triggered by emotions. And let’s be honest, emotion isn’t your strong suit. I believe Rowan was right. Something bad is going to happen, and I need to stop it. Starting with that monster. Whoever it is. [thunder rumbles] [scoffs] [mellow synth-pop music playing] [Wednesday] I thought nothing scared me, but that was before I stared into the eyes of Joseph Crackstone. I don’t believe in heaven or hell. But I do believe in revenge. I usually serve it warm with a side of pain, but I’ve never faced an adversary cast in bronze. [mellow music continues] [Walker] Thank you. It is my honor to celebrate our town’s history and Jericho’s noble forefather, Joseph Crackstone. Now, he believed that with a happy heart and an open ear, there was nothing our town couldn’t achieve. So together as one, our community and our friends at Nevermore Academy, we’ve built a monument to celebrate his memory. Now, may the spirit of Joseph Crackstone be memorialized for eternity.

The mayor is furious! I’ve lost count of the angry phone calls, emails, and people in the town, alumni and parents. They want answers and so do I. I would lead the inquisition, but I left my thumbscrews and rack at home. Miss Addams… you’re already on thin ice. Wafer-thin ice. I swear on my late scorpion’s soul, my hands are clean. [cheekily dramatic music playing] [music ends abruptly] I may not have hard evidence, but I see you. You’re a trouble magnet. If trouble means standing up to lies, decades of discrimination, centuries of treating outcasts like second-class citizens or worse… What are you talking about? Jericho. Why does this town even have an Outreach Day? Don’t you know its real history with outcasts? The actual story of Joseph Crackstone? I do. To an extent. Then why be complicit in its cover up? Those who forget history are doomed to repeat it. [pensive music playing] That’s where you and I differ. Where you see doom, I see opportunity. Maybe this is a chance to rewrite the wrongs, to start a new chapter in the normie-outcast relations. Nothing has changed since Crackstone. They still hate us. Only now they sugarcoat it with platitudes and smiles. If you’re unwilling to fight for truth… You don’t think I want the truth? Of course I do. But the world isn’t always black a',\n",

So glad I have my date with Ajax tonight. Get my mind off that trainwreck of an afternoon. I literally think I have PTSD. I didn’t even get to do my dance routine. What a tragedy. What kind of twisted psycho would want to sabotage such a life-affirming event? You’re going to be late. [typewriter keys clacking] Wish me luck. If he\\xa0breaks your heart, I’ll nail-gun his. [elegant instrumental music playing] [Wednesday] I don’t believe in mandatory volunteer work, sugar-coated history, or happy endings, but most of all… I don’t believe in coincidences. [gasps softly] [sirens wailing] [elegant instrumental cover of “Nothing Else Matters” by Metallica] To paraphrase Agatha Christie, one coincidence is just a coincidence, two are a clue… [Ajax humming] …and three are proof. No! [sighs] Rowan’s drawing of me and Crackstone happens sometime in the future. Goody Addams’ warnings about Crackstone were in the past. And the monster is here in the present. Three coincidences that I know are connected. That monster could be anyone. The sheriff thinks they only exist behind the walls of this school. The truth is, there are monsters everywhere. [muffled screaming] And sometimes the monsters we least suspect are the most dangerous. [shrieks] [metallic scraping] [shrieks] They don’t need teeth and claws to terrify.

Have a dance for me! [upbeat pop music playing] Welcome to the Rave’N. Well, here’s to a night they’ll never forget. Careful what you wish for. [Thornhill] You were a Nevermore student once. Don’t you remember being full of hope and excitement about the Rave’N? All I remember is disappointment. The boy I asked turned me down for another girl. Morticia Frump, in fact. Wednesday’s mother?

Guessing you had Thing drop it in the tip jar? Good guess. After our last conversation, I wasn’t sure I’d even get to speak to you again, but… Well, your note was so genuine and… sweet. Totally took me by surprise. Me too. Well, now that I’m here, I’m glad I came. You need a few minutes? Genuine and sweet? How could you do this to me? [frustrated sigh] [Thing snaps twice] [grandiose, elegant music playing] How’d you pay for it? Five-finger discount, of course. Thing, don’t look. [darkly grandiose music playing] Wow, you look… Unrecognizable? Ridiculous? A classic example of female objectification for the male gaze? Amazing. I mean it, Wednesday. You look beautiful. Eugene? Wednesday, what’s going on? [pop music playing faintly] What happened to staking out the cave? Sure, I get it. Guess I’ll check out the woods myself. Don’t go alone. It’s too dangerous. Stand down. We’ll go together tomorrow night, understood? Staking out a cave? A Hummer never shies away from danger.

I mean, I could give you a million excuses, but… the truth is I’m still trying to figure that out. I got sent away to this boot camp and realized that’s not the version of myself I want to be. A bitter townie that blames everyone else for the shitty hand he’s been dealt. Look, I did a terrible thing, but I swear I’m not a terrible person.

It’s a mild prophylactic, so to speak. That’s why Xavier broke up with me. He could never fully trust me. The worst part is I could never trust his feelings either.

At present time, the Addamses visit Wednesday for parents’ weekend at Nevermore. A family therapy session is cut short when Wednesday confronts her parents about the suspected murder. Meanwhile, Sheriff Galpin learns that the coroner has committed suicide after admitting to fabricating Gates’s\\xa0autopsy\\xa0report. Galpin concludes that Gomez is guilty and arrests him. In prison, Gomez reveals to Wednesday that Gates was killed by accident, while Morticia confesses to killing Gates. Wednesday and Morticia dig up Gates’s grave to find that he had been lethally poisoned before he could be killed, but are caught by police and arrested for the night. Later, they confront Mayor Walker who reveals that Garrett intended to poison the entire school due to his father’s hate for outcasts. Mayor Walker agrees to release Gomez after admitting to covering up Gates’s motive. Back at Nevermore, Weems reluctantly admits to covering up Rowan’s death by means of shapeshifting in an effort to evade controversy at the school. * * * [tense, enigmatic music playing] [Wednesday] How well do we really know our parents? Take my father. I’ve always considered him an open book. A man given to misguided schemes and exaggerated displays of affection. But when he was a student, he was accused of a murder that took place right up there. Which leads me to wonder… [intense, unsettling music playing] …what really happened that stormy night 32 years ago? [screams] [music swells] I think he had a sword, and they certainly have issues. I don’t like to tell tales, Sheriff Walker, but it’s all Morticia Frump’s fault. They were fighting over her. Tish… I don’t know what to say, Gomez. Seeing you in handcuffs, accused of murder… I’ve never loved you more. Cara mia. All right, that’s enough, Addams. Let’s go. Let’s move it out. Let’s get going. [officer bangs on car] [jauntily macabre music playing] [quirkily dreary music playing] Ah, the fetid air of teenage angst. These were the best years of our lives, were they not, Tish? They certainly were, mi cariño. I hope Wednesday’s happy to see us. I left a dozen messages on her crystal ball. Still no reply. Fret not, my plum-lipped cupid. I’m sure she’s dying to see us. [Gomez] Mmm. [Pugsley] Come on, let’s go. [bell tolls] Nevermore was created as a safe haven for our children to learn and to grow, no matter who or what they are. [applause] I realize most of you have heard about the unfortunate incident involving one of our students. But I’m happy to report that Eugene is on the mend and is expected to make a full recovery. So let’s focus on the positive and make this Parents’ Weekend our very best yet. [Wednesday] On the mend? Try in a coma. Have you been to see him? You’re his friend. I’m the reason he’s in the hospital. That is not your fault, okay? The monster hasn’t attacked ',\n",

[quirky music continuing] I knew I should have worn my plague mask. Would you look at my family? [howling] Talk about toxic pack mentality. I give my mom 30 seconds before her judge-y claws come out. [Enid sighs] Let’s get this over with. There she is. Oh, how we missed those accusing eyes and youthful sneer. How are you, my little rain cloud? I thought Thing was filling you in on my every move. I uncovered your feeble subterfuge almost immediately. So, how’s the little fella doing? Does he still have all his fingers? Relax. I haven’t snapped any of his digits. Yet. So tell us everything. Since you’ve abandoned me here, I’ve been hunted, haunted… and the target of an attempted murder. Ah, Nevermore. I love you so. Enid. Oh, let me look at you. One-one-thousand, two-one-thousand… Have you not been waxing? Three seconds. That’s a personal best. [sniffing] Are you feeling well? You’re looking a touch anemic. Have you been eating enough red meat? It’s good to see you too, Mom. And you, Dad. [somber, inquisitive music playing] Not sure how much more of this family togetherness I can take. Think you skipped where you apologize for acting like a jerk last weekend. I’m sorry for what happened at the dance. I shouldn’t have asked you to siren-song me like that. Guessing your dad’s a no-show again this year? Yeah. I got a text this morning. You? Gabrielle hasn’t shown her face since I started here. Probably sunning herself somewhere in the Seychelles. [woman] My darling daughter. I made it. Wouldn’t miss this for the world. I guess you misjudged her. [music builds ominously, fades away] [gasps softly] Our old yearbook. I haven’t laid eyes on this in over 20 years. Such good times we had, didn’t we, Larissa? Some of us better than others. Oh, don’t be so modest. You always filled a room with your presence. Like a stately sequoia tree. And I guess that would make you the lumberjack. [laughs] There’s that biting sense of humor that I always adored. Do you remember when we did that duet for the Solstice Talent Show? Your Judy Garland impression was a dead ringer. Sounds positively suicidal. Oh. My picture’s gone. Really? Well, that is odd. May I borrow this for the weekend? That way Gomez and I can take a little walk down memory lane. Rawr. [purrs playfully] [Weems] All right. Let’s get down to the matter at hand, shall we? Hmm? Unfortunately, Wednesday’s assimilation has been rocky at best. Because I refuse to embrace the culture of dishonesty and denial permeating this school. Starting with the monster that killed Rowan and put Eugene in the ICU. Although I do hear he’s on the mend. We’ve always encouraged Wednesday to speak her mind. Sometimes her sharp tongue can cut deep. Apparently her therapist feels she hasn’t been very open to the process. Their tim',\n",

Dr. Kinbott and I have spoken, and we both agree it would be most beneficial for you all to attend a family session this weekend. No. I thought that might be your reaction, but your parents can see the wisdom in it. Um, not to side with Wednesday, but, um, we’re only here for the weekend. Oh, come on. What can it hurt? To be honest, I’ve always been a big fan of head-shrinking. It’s not that kind of head-shrinking, mon chéri. Well, that is disappointing. But anything for our little girl. Ah. [quirkily dreary music playing] Yeah. You make sure they search that cave for any sign of that creature. No stone unturned. They bag and tag everything, all right? And then follow up with the lab. I want the DNA results on that claw. We already got one kid in the ICU, a bunch of people in the morgue. I don’t want any more. All right. [foreboding music playing] Son of a bitch. What’s wrong? Just hard to stomach a murderer wandering around town scot-free. At least they care enough about Wednesday to go to therapy with her. Tyler, come on. We’ve been through this. I’m just… I’m not comfortable dredging up the family past with some complete stranger. Think it’s easy for me to sit there and talk about my crap? [phone ringing] I’ve got a lot on my plate now, bud. You got the results already? All right. Tape off the scene. I’ll be right there. Dad. You okay? What’s going on? [sighs] You know Reggie, the local coroner? He just blew his brains out. [ticking] So, who wants to start? Maybe we can discuss what it’s like having Wednesday away from home? I mean, for me… [hesitating]…it’s been hard not having Wednesday around. I never thought I’d miss being waterboarded so much. Morticia, Gomez. How have you been coping? It’s been torture for us too. [Gomez] Fortunately, my brother Fester’s rack fits two people. [Morticia] Nothing like a good stretch to bring out the best in each other. Querida mía. [kissing passionately] Um… [long, protracted smooch] Enough! I think it’s high time my parents faced the music. It seems they’ve been lying to me. Keeping secrets. Murderous secrets that need to be addressed. [dramatic music playing] Who was Garrett Gates, and why are you\\xa0accused of murdering him? Whoa. Those charges were dropped. Your father is an innocent man. Local sheriff doesn’t seem too convinced. Wednesday, stop. This is neither the time nor the place. Actually, this is exactly the place. These sessions are… Doctor. This does not concern you. And I refuse to debate a decades-old witch-hunt with you right now. I… Darling, maybe we should… No. This session is over. Have it your way, Mother. Wednes… Wednesday? If you refuse to tell me the truth, I’ll just have to excavate it myself. You… Thanks for the candy. Actually, that’s potpourri. Why don’t you take the bowl?

We are a personal development movement that helps people take control of their lives. After you take control of their bank accounts. I haven’t come here to fight, Brandy Jane. My name is Bianca. New name. New life. It’s time to come home. That place was never my home. Gideon said you’d resist. Don’t say that man’s name to me. You think he’d give a damn about some single mom and her daughter if we weren’t sirens? [chuckles] That is no way to talk about your stepfather. You actually married him. He wants you to come home, so that we can be a real family. Hard pass. He’s already got one siren to do his bidding. Goodbye, Ma. I don’t want to see more MorningSong bracelets anywhere near this town. My siren song is drying up. [distressing music playing] Recruitment numbers are down, and the wrong people are starting to ask questions. This wasn’t a request. And if I refuse? Then everybody here is gonna know how you siren’d your way into Nevermore. I finally make something of myself and you want to destroy it. You haven’t made squat, Bianca. [laughs maliciously] You’re just scamming a higher class of people, but they are not your friends. Sooner or later they will see through you. A siren can never change her scales. You got until the end of the weekend to say your goodbyes. [music builds, fades away] [Wednesday sighs] I harvested hive number three. [monitor beeps] The bees miss you, Eugene. [labored breathing] We all do. [melancholy music playing] [Thing tapping] Thanks for keeping an eye on him. Any updates? He didn’t deserve this. I should be in that bed. Why did you go without me? [gasps] Didn’t mean to startle you, dear. You must be Wednesday. Eugene’s moms. Sue and Janet. You were all he could talk about lately. He was so happy you joined the Hummers. Eugene hasn’t had the easiest time fitting in at Nevermore. [Sue] He was so excited to finally make a real friend. I brought him some honey. Eugene loves those dang bees like they’re his kids. His fuzzy-buzzy babies. [Sue] He’s gonna be okay, right? I should go. [poignant, melancholy music playing] [mysterious music playing] First time someone’s killed themselves in the morgue. Guys don’t know what to do with the body. What do you got? Gun was legal and registered in his name. Colt .45. Janitor said he kept it in his desk. I just saw Doc last week. He was planning a cruise with his wife. He seemed excited all about retirement. Guess you never know what’s going through someone’s mind. A bullet, apparently. We got security footage? Nope. Camera was obscured. Black bubblegum. I got them scrubbing through video to find out how long it’s been',\n",
              "  ' there. [Galpin] Black bubblegum. You don’t say… The suicide note says he felt guilty about an old case. Says he covered it up, faked the coroner’s report, and has been living with guilt for all these years. [Galpin] What case? Uh, Garrett Gates. Garrett Gates. You gotta be kidding me. You heard of it? I’ve been waiting 30 years to put away his murderer. You know who did it? There’s only ever been one suspect. I always thought they were covering up the truth. Now I got my proof. [low, menacing music building] [inquisitive music playing] [birds cawing] [Morticia] Mmm. I am famished. You’re not hungry, darling? My appetite eludes me, Mother. The same way the truth eludes you. We need to tell her. She’ll never believe us. We must stay strong. And hope that something more morbid comes along to distract her. [dramatic music playing] So are you going to make me ask? Ajax and I haven’t defined our relationship yet. I’m not talking about boys. Have you wolfed out yet? No. Well, that is a disappointment. That’s me. A huge disappointment. Can I ask what this is about, Sheriff? What’s happening, Ms. Thornhill? I have no idea. [Galpin] Gomez Addams. How can I help you, Sheriff? You’re under arrest for the murder of Garrett Gates. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. Dad? You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford one, one will be appointed for you. [foreboding music playing] [grunts] [handcuffs unlocking] [Thing sliding against pane] My little tormenta, how’s your mother? Devastated. She hates you in orange. I caught her laying a rose on a grave earlier today. The headstone read “Garrett Gates.” The very boy you’ve been arrested for murdering. Care to explain? [tense music playing] Garrett was infatuated with your mother. He mistook her kindness for interest. His infatuation turned into obsession, and he started stalking her. Why didn’t you call the police? We tried. But his family were the oldest and richest in Jericho. No one believed us. Garrett’s father, an outcast-hating bigot, was furious that your mother had accused his only son. It all came to a head the night of the Rave’N Dance. Your mother and I stepped out to catch our breath. [intense, sweeping music playing] Addams! And that’s when I saw him. He had broken into the school. His twisted love for your mother had made him insane. His eyes bore into me, brimming with murderous intent. Go. Get out of here. He won’t hurt me. Garrett, no! Garrett, stop! [bold, combative music playing] [both grunting] [sword clinking] My life flashed before my eyes. Driven by jealousy and hate, Garrett was unstoppable. [grunts] [Gomez straining] When I saw the sword, my survival instinct kicked in. [Garrett grunts] It was a terrible accident. [wet squelch] [Weems shrieks] [Wednesday] If I’m being objective, his confession sounds entirely plausible, delivered with the perfect degree of sincerity.',\n",
              "  ' Perhaps my father is exactly what he says. Thank you for being honest with me. But then there’s the matter of his tells. The way he smooths his mustache. The way he delivers a comforting wink. I’ve been playing Russian roulette with him since I was 12. I know them well. I’m sorry I wasn’t a better father. Could we please do without the overt display of emotion? I know they make you feel uncomfortable. How many fathers hand their daughter a fencing blade when she’s five? Your saber strokes were an essay in perfection. Or teach her how to swim with sharks? They found you as cold-blooded as I do. The right way to flay a rattlesnake? They really do taste like chicken when prepared properly. The point is, you taught me how to be strong and independent. How to navigate myself in a world full of treachery and prejudice. You are the reason I understand how imperative it is that I never lose sight of myself. [lachrymose music playing] So as far as fatherhood goes, I would say you’ve been more than adequate. Gracias, Wednesday. [Wednesday] We need to talk. How the hell did you get in? Bernice? Bernice! Bernice may or may not have received a call that her tabby cat Swifty is being held for ransom. My father did not kill Garrett Gates. Well, I have his signed confession, and he identified the saber he used to do it. Both of which I’m about to deliver to the District Attorney. Don’t you find the timing convenient? The coroner kills himself out of remorse for a decades-old murder case the very weekend my father, your prime suspect, deigns to return to town. All I see is a guilty man who’s finally going to pay for his crime. And cuffing him myself, oh, that was the icing on the cake. How are you failing to see that someone is desperately trying to derail my investigation? I found the monster’s cave, and I gave you the DNA evidence. Did you even bother to test it? This may come as a shock, but the world doesn’t revolve around you. Here. DNA results. No match. Inconclusive. So you truly believe this is all some coincidence? Whoever hurt Eugene also murdered the coroner. Unfortunately, someone sabotaged the security camera in the morgue, so we don’t know what happened. They stuck bubblegum on the lens. Black bubblegum. Maybe I should run DNA on that? Someone is trying to throw me off my game. This is all a distraction. No, this is about justice being served. Garrett Gates’s family deserves closure, even if none of them are around to take comfort in it. What happened to them? His mother hung herself in the backyard. His father drank himself to an early grave. Even his little sister didn’t escape. She was orphaned, sent overseas, ended up drowning. Every last one of them’s gone. Your father doesn’t just have Garrett’s blood on his hands, he’s got the whole damn family’s. [dramatic music builds, trails off] [pack growling playfully] Here. I brought you a gift. That’s so sweet. You didn’t have to get me anything. I know, b',\n",

Brochures. For summer camp. These aren’t just ordinary summer camps. These are camps for lycanthropy conversion. Oh, no need to be dramatic, Enid. You want to send me to conversion therapy for werewolves? It worked wonders for your cousin Lucille, didn’t it? Seven weeks in the Balkan countryside and she was howling at the moon in no time. As it should be. Don’t you want to wolf out and finally be normal, honey? Go away. You forgot your fishing gear. Stop trying to be nice. It doesn’t suit you. Father packed your favorite bait. [Pugsley] What’ll happen to him now? Well, he’s confessed, so there won’t be a trial. After he’s sentenced, he’ll be sent to a state penitentiary, where he’ll lose his mind being separated from Mother. Did you know they haven’t spent a night apart since they tied the knot? I always thought I’d be the first one in the family behind bars. Lurch and I had a bet going. Come on. Let’s see if the fish are biting. [grenade pin clicks] [plop] [Wednesday] That’s quite a catch. I’m gonna miss him, Wednesday. It’s not over yet. He’s innocent. Well, if anyone can figure out who really committed the crime… it’s you. You have to find out the truth and free Dad. Well, until that happens, we both know Mother will be falling apart. Which means we have to be strong. And by “we,” I mean you. Now, give me one of those. [plop] Where is Mother anyway? She said she wanted to be alone. Somewhere where no one would find her. [chilling music playing] [Wednesday] Hello, Mother. Hello, Wednesday. So you’re a Nightshade. That didn’t take long. Actually, I rejected them. Why? Because I was a member? I’ll never live up to your legacy here, so why try? I win the Poe Cup, you claimed it four times. I join the fencing team, you captained it. Why would you send me somewhere I could only ever exist in your shadow? It’s not a competition, Wednesday. Everything is a competition, Mother. But mostly I rejected them because they’re a trivial social club. We used to be so much more. Our mission was to protect outcasts from harm and bigotry. In fact, the group was started by an ancestor of your father’s from Mexico. One of the first settlers in America. Goody. I saw her painting at Pilgrim World. Oh. How ironic, since she was the one who killed Joseph Crackstone. The Nightshades were her secret, but deadly, answer to his oppression. I know why you’ve come here, Wednesday. So go on. Ask. Father didn’t kill Garrett Gates, did he? No. [thunderclaps] [swords clanging] [Morticia] By the time I made it up the stairs, I found your father fighting for his life. It was terrifying. Garrett, no! [grunts] [panting] [both grunting, struggling] [Morticia] Garrett! Garrett, stop! Leave him alone! I’ll never forget the way he looked at me. He was even foaming at the m',\n",
              "  'outh. It was like I was staring into the eyes of a rabid beast. [grandly menacing music playing] [wet squelch] [shuddering] [blade rasps] Oh, no. [thud] [Weems screams] [Morticia] It was only when I heard the scream that I realized what I’d done. Your father was so… calm and brave. [dramatic music swells] Tish, you need to leave right now. Go to your room and lock the door. You were never here. [erratic panting] You understand me? Morticia? Put this back on the table. Go. Okay. Your father took the blame in order to protect me. I was so grateful when they cleared him of any wrongdoing. But I knew, someday this would come back to haunt us. You said Garrett was foaming at the mouth. His eyes didn’t look human. I’ve never seen someone so blinded by rage. Maybe it wasn’t rage at all. Foaming saliva, dilated pupils, mental confusion. What are those all textbook symptoms of? [delicate, inquisitive music playing] [Morticia gasps] But how can that be? There’s only one way to find out. [sighs dreamily] This reminds me of when you got your first grave-digging kit. You were so happy, you nearly smiled. Are you sure you don’t want to join? Uh… mm… No, that’s okay, darling. I don’t want to spoil your fun. [scoffs, grunts] [hollow thud] [banging] Moment of truth. [inhaling fondly] Hello, Garrett. I was right. [Santiago] Well, well, what do we have here? Guess there’s gonna be an Addams family reunion in lockup tonight. You’re both under arrest. [Galpin] Get comfortable. You can post bail in the morning. [Morticia and Gomez kissing passionately] Not even the long arm of the law could keep us apart. At least we’ll have one last night together. Yes. I’ve seen jackals with more self-control than you two. Neither one of you are strong enough to serve hard time. And thanks to me, you won’t have to. I knew our little jailbird would have an escape plan. [tense music playing] It’s a souvenir from our outing. I borrowed it from Garrett. He died from nightshade poisoning. The remarkable preservation of soft tissue and blue tint confirms it. Which means Garrett was dying… Before you stabbed him. [gasps] You look even more ravishing as an innocent woman. Yes. For once, could you two get off of each other and focus. [eerie whooshing] Prove to me you’re still worthy to be called my son! Kill all those outcasts! Sneak into that dance and spike the punch bowl. [thunder crashes] Addams! [shattering reverberates] [Morticia] Wednesday. Did you have a vision? What happened? What did you see? The night Garrett died, he had a vial of nightshade poison that broke in his pocket. He wasn’t just trying to kill father. He was going to use the nightshade poison to murder the entire school. Thank you for seeing us at such short notice, Mr. Mayor. Yes, well, veiled threats have that effect. Garrett Gates wasn’t killed by a stab wound. [Walker clears throat] That blue sheen is a telltale sign of nightshade poisoning. But you already knew that, did',\n",
              "  'n’t you? Because back when you were sheriff, you were in charge and covered it up. [inhales, exhales deeply] Ansel Gates hated outcasts and Nevermore. He claimed the land the school was built on was stolen from his family over 200 years ago. Garrett went there that night to spike the punch and kill all the kids at that dance. Ansel confessed the whole thing to me in a drunken stupor. It was his idea. Why did you instruct Dr. Anwar to falsify the autopsy report? You knew the truth about how he really died. Listen, my job was to keep the peace. If there had been a trial, Jericho’s and Nevermore’s reputations would have been trashed. I think the only reputation you were worried about ruining was your own. I remember Garrett bragging to me that his father had the sheriff in his pocket. One year later, you get elected mayor. Hmm. No doubt with the full support of Ansel Gates. I resent your implication. What I resent is that you could have prevented Garrett’s death if you had done your job when I lodged my complaint about him stalking me. But no. Men like you have no idea what it feels like not to be believed. [sighs] What do you want? [quirky, intense music playing] All charges dropped. My father will be released immediately with a full and unequivocal apology from the sheriff’s office. [emphatically] Do we have a deal? You were very impressive in there. When did your visions begin? A few months ago. Hmm. Before I left for Nevermore. I’m sorry you didn’t feel you could tell me. I know we’ve had our difficulties lately. Navigating the treacherous shoals of our mother-daughter relationship. But I’m always here for you, Wednesday. Always. Sometimes when I touch someone or something, I get these very violent glimpses from the past or future. I don’t know how to control it. Our psychic ability resides on the spectrum of who we are. Given my disposition, my visions tend to be positive. That makes me a Dove. And for someone like me? Who sees the world through a darker lens? You’re a Raven. Your visions are more potent, more powerful. But without the proper training, they can lead to madness. If I could help you, I would, Wednesday. But we’re not trained by the living. Somebody from our bloodline reaches out from beyond to help us when we’re ready. Goody has. I’ve seen her before. Be careful, Wednesday. Goody was a witch of great strength, but her vengeance pushed her too far, and even she couldn’t save herself. Sorry about all this. I don’t hold grudges, only blood debts. So, your daughter and my son have become… close. I pity any boy who gets caught in her viper’s gaze, but he must be a good egg. She wouldn’t tolerate anything less. He has his mom to thank for that. [Pugsley] Dad! I missed you so much, Dad. I missed you so much. Querida. [Morticia] Mi amor. [Wednesday] Don’t crowd me. [curious music playing] [bell tolls] So, it’s decided. Six weeks at Camp Howl. You’ll need to pick which activity… No, I don’t. Be',\n",

I hope that one day, you’ll finally accept me for who I am. [somber, emotional music playing] I’m proud of you, kiddo. You do you. I’ll come back and help you under one condition. Wait until the school year is over. How do I know you won’t run away again? Because we both have too much to lose. But after this, you and MorningSong are out of my life… forever. [Wednesday] Don’t push it. Well, at least we can’t say Parents’ Weekend wasn’t a nail-biter. I knew you didn’t have what it takes to be a murderer. As much as that stings, gracias, my little death trap. Mwah. As I leafed through the pages of this yearbook, I was reminded of all the wonderful times I had here. But they were just that. Mine. You have your own path to blaze. I don’t want to be a stranger in your life, darling. If you need me for anything, anything at all, I’m only a crystal ball away. Thank you, Mother. [wry exhale] [air kisses] [dramatic, resolute music playing] I knew it. I did witness Rowan getting murdered that night. Excuse me? When Rowan appeared the next morning, it was you. When you participated in the talent show, not only did you impersonate Judy Garland, you became her. You’re a shape-shifter. [scoffs] That’s a fascinating theory. I’m curious to find out how Sheriff Galpin feels when I tell him. [low, menacing music playing] You won’t tell a soul, Miss Addams. And it wouldn’t matter much if you did. Rowan’s father already knows what happened, and he fully supports my decision not to involve the authorities. Why would he agree to that? Because Rowan was not in his right mind. His telekinetic abilities were driving him mad and he attempted to murder you twice. His tragic death allowed us to rectify the situation without casting the school or Rowan in an unflattering light. You and Mayor Walker are the same, aren’t you? Burying bodies to cover your dirty secrets. I did what I needed to do to shield this school from controversy and protect its students from harm.

During a surprise birthday party, Wednesday has a vision of Goody who instructs her to seek out the Gates mansion. There, she witnesses Mayor Walker as he is leaving the building and sneaks into his car. After arriving back in town, Mayor Walker is run over and severely injured. Weems locks down the school and forbids Wednesday to leave campus. With Tyler and Enid’s help, she escapes and returns to the Gates mansion. There, they discover that Laurel Gates, Garrett’s relative long believed to be dead, might still be alive. They find the severed bodyparts of the monster’s victims in a cellar, but are forced to escape after being ambushed by the monster. Wednesday leads Galpin to the cellar, only to find it empty. At Nevermore, Wednesday convinces Weems not to expel her in order to be able to further pursue her investigation. At the hospital, an unknown figure kills Mayor Walker. * * * [ominous, suspenseful music playing] [unearthly, indistinct whispering] [Wednesday] In case you’re wondering, I don’t hold séances very often. I can barely tolerate the living. Why would I want to commune with the dead? But my mother told me Goody is the only one that can train me to control my psychic ability. The sooner I master that, the sooner I crack this case. [whispering continues] [door creaks] [wind whistles] [music builds] [music trails off] [annoyed sigh] Sorry. I didn’t mean to interrupt your… Uh, do I even want to know? I was reaching into the black maw of death to contact a relative. Feels very on-brand for you. You have a relative named Goody? She was one of the original outcasts. Been attempting to summon her, but she seems to be ignoring my entreaties. Oh, you thought about using one of my scented candles? The aroma of steak tartare is to die for. [paper flutters] Maybe Goody answered you after all. I doubt she communicates in magazine cutouts. [cryptic music playing] [birdsong] [branches snapping] [Enid’s claws clatter] You insisted on coming along. I was fine on my own. [foreboding music playing] Seems like our wannabe Deep Throat is already here. Ew. What died? Smells like childhood. Come on. Second thoughts. Why don’t I just stay out here? You know, as a lookout.

What part of “no party under the penalty of death” do you not understand? I thought my cake design was pretty inspired. The pink balloon was my little touch. Why don’t you make a wish? [Wednesday] Wait, it’s Latin. Fire will rain… when I rise. That’s not really a wish. The first part of that was burned onto Nevermore’s lawn. It can’t be a coincidence. Wait, we’re never eating that cake, are we? [eerie whooshing] [low whispering] Crackstone is coming. Crackstone is coming. [disorienting music playing] Goody. You’re the Raven in my bloodline. Wednesday. I was told you could teach me how to control my ability. There is no controlling a raging river. You must learn to navigate it without drowning. Time is not on our side. To stop Crackstone, this place you must seek. Do you always speak in riddles? Do you always seek simple answers? The path of a Raven is a solitary one. You end up alone, unable to trust others, only seeing the darkness within them. Is that supposed to scare me? It should. [jauntily macabre music playing] Careful, that’s my cold shoulder. [Enid] Don’t blame Thing. The party was my idea. Everyone deserves to be celebrated on their birthday. I prefer to be vilified. What happened? It looked like you were having a seizure. I wasn’t that lucky. Can I at least get some kudos for pulling one over on you? The subterfuge was impressive. [Thing thudding] “May your 16th be as sour and misery-filled as your desire.” “Your ever-doting mother and father.” They asked Thing to hide it before they left on Parents’ Weekend. Ew! That’s so gross. I would’ve preferred live squirrels. While we’re still accepting presents… [twinkling, wondrous music playing] Well, do you like it? What is it exactly? It’s a snood, silly. I made it in your signature colors. And you want to know what the best part is? I have one too! [gobsmacked silence] We can wear them together to class. Oh, Enid, this is far too unique to wear to something like class. I suggest we wait for a more special occasion, like a funeral. [softly] Oh. You know, Lucas feels terrible about what happened at the dance. Forgive my skepticism, given his latest act of vandalism. He had nothing to do with burning those words onto your lawn. He’s been grounded for the last week. Fine. He does his community service here, and we forget it ever happened. Yes',\n",
              "  ', well… I’m in your debt, Larissa. I don’t need your gratitude. Just find the delinquents responsible. Perhaps start with Lucas’s cohorts. Right after we track down whatever attacked the Ottinger boy. Although all fingers would point to one of your own students. Careful, Noble. My charity has its limits. [mysterious music playing] In the crypt, you had another vision, didn’t you? I didn’t realize we were back on speaking terms. I showed up to your surprise party. I figured that would have been a hint. What did you see? Who said I was ready to speak with you? Still think I’m the monster? Haven’t ruled it out. When you change your mind and you want my help, you know where to find me. [mysterious music continues] Where’d you get that? The bracelet, where’d you get it? Lucas. Nice to meet you. Bianca. I know. Last week at the Weathervane, my dad said I had to get my act together. After he left, this woman in the next booth told me about this self-help app, MorningSong. Said it could help me refocus my life. Usually I’d call BS on something like that, but for some reason… You believed her. Yeah, and she turned out to be right, so I signed up. And they sent me this. I guarantee MorningSong doesn’t give a damn about your well-being. They’re only interested in your money. Do yourself a favor. Delete that app. The more you listen to them, the more they sink their claws into you. How do you know? I just do. Which is why I’m warning the normie idiot who ruined my killer dress with his bullshit prank to not get sucked into MorningSong. Because you’re just the type they’re looking for. Guessing that’s not a compliment. What do you care, anyway? I’m trying not to turn into my mother. She’s like the ghost of bitchiness future. Hey. [poignant music playing] I’ll be at the Weathervane later, if you want to stop by. Maybe we can exchange notes on self-improvement. [door opens, closes] I haven’t always been against birthdays. Each one reminds me I’m a year closer to death’s cold embrace. What’s not to like about that? Besides, my parents always made sure my birthdays were memorable.

Got our hands dirty. Gardening? Grave-digging. Hmm. And I managed to keep my father out of prison. What brings you here? Eugene’s moms, I’m working with them. Trauma like this leaves emotional scars on the whole family. They had to head home for a few days, so I promised I’d check in on him. I’ll leave you to it. [Kinbott] Who’s Goody? [inscrutable music playing] She’s a very distant cousin. Very distant. Sounds like she doesn’t see you for who you really are. She sees more than you know. I want to assure you I remain as cold and heartless as the first day we met. I doubt a cold, heartless person would be sitting by her friend’s bedside feeling guilt for his condition. I didn’t ask for a free session. Consider it my birthday gift. [chuckles] [eerie notes twinkle] [knocking] Come in. This just arrived from London. Copy of an old death certificate you requested. Thanks, Agnes. Oh, by the way, has Inez Bloom called again? You mean about the lights at the old Gates place? Couple days ago. I referred her to the sheriff’s office. I know you’re usually a quad kind of girl, but I’ve been working on that all week. Birthday, yes. Happy, never. Is there anyone Thing didn’t tell? Well, who do you think delivered the cake? Yeah, I went with the 98% dark chocolate ganache knowing your… preferred color palette. [country music playing faintly from speakers] Oh, is that, uh… that Enid’s gift? It’s perfect if you’re fleeing a war-torn country on foot. Come on. Don’t you like a day that’s all about you? Every day is all about me. This one just comes with cake and a bad song. So, if I asked you out to a non-birthday, song-free dinner… would that be something you’re interested in? I have a tight deadline. Emphasis on dead. Term paper? It’s about how whitewashing the sins of our past will come back to kill us all. Oh. [delicate, unnerving music playing] Have you seen that before? Uh… What’s that supposed to be? Never mind. Okay, did… did I do something? I just feel like ever since the Rave’N, you’ve kind of been ghosting me. Am I wrong? [tender, emotional music playing] Guess I got my answer. Tall, black, two sugars, to go? [music fades away] That threat burned onto the lawn at school, it’s also etched on the wall inside Crackstone’s crypt. Don’t tell me you’ve been digging up more bodies. There’s a connection there. I know i',\n",

Was the monster in them? No, but I could feel it in the shadows. You know, kind of lurking in my mind. [Wednesday] You know where this is? Yeah. It’s the old Gates mansion. I pass it when I go running. Why? [Xavier clears throat] Okay. Listen… After the dance, I just wanted to forget about you, but I couldn’t. So I started painting and that’s what came out. I can hear you up there playing. [playing “Cello Concerto in E minor” by Elgar] I can tell how you get lost in the music. I feel like it’s the only time I get to see the real you. [frustrated sigh] [phone keyboard clacking] You’re Bianca, right? Uh, could you do me a favor? Wednesday forgot this. Could you give it back to her? Birthday gift from Enid. Aren’t you her boyfriend? Definitely not. Sure, no problem. I was just leaving anyway. Didn’t think you were actually going to show. Me neither. Took your advice. Seriously, why are you here? I didn’t think any outcast would ever speak to me again. Just… wanted someone to talk to. I feel like we’re in the same boat. My mother showed up last week to remind me that sirens can never change their scales. No matter how hard I try, there will always be people who look down on me. My mission is to prove her wrong. I just figured you could relate. [gentle, tender music playing] Most people think I’ll never amount to anything. And while we’re being honest, I haven’t done much to make them think differently. Why did you trash the dance? I don’t know. Guess I was angry that my dad was humiliated on Outreach Day. Wanted payback. But then after we did it, I kind of felt like crap. I realized I needed to wipe the board, you know? Start over. If that makes any sense. More than you know. [foreboding music playing] [Wednesday] This is where Garrett Gates lived.

I’m gonna have to lay it out for you. We’ll do it over pie at the Weathervane, just like the old days. See you soon. [shocked gasp] No! [tires screeching] Noble! Call 911! Get an ambulance! [distressing music swells] [siren wailing] [Galpin] He’s alive. Barely. I’ll take you back after I get your statement. I already gave it to your deputy. Blue Cadillac with no license plates. Yeah, I know. I want a better one. What were you doing in the mayor’s SUV? I saw him coming out of the Gates mansion. The Gates mansion. What the hell were you doing there? House hunting. I overheard the voicemail he left you. I was intrigued. Back when the mayor was sheriff, he used to have a lot of wild theories on cases that he couldn’t solve. So… we’d dissect them over pie, sitting right back there in that booth. Most of the time they went nowhere. Call me old-fashioned, but when someone is run over on their way to give the police key information, it usually means they were onto something. And all signs point to the Gates family and that house. The Gates family. How? They’re all dead. Every last one of them. And I don’t believe in ghosts. Maybe you should. How do you end up at the center of every terrible thing that happens here? Incredible luck. As of now, the school is on full lockdown, and your off-campus privileges are revoked until further notice. [frenetic clacking] Wednesday, I just heard what happened to Mayor Walker. Are you all right? I… I can’t imagine witnessing something like that. [typewriter dings] It was on my bucket list. You can tell the warden I’m still in my cell. Principal Weems is only looking out for your best interests. You could have been seriously hurt or worse. Oh. How goes the novel? Viper’s investigation has been thwarted on several fronts, but she’s plotting her next course of action. [keys clacking] Sounds intriguing. I saw this on my bookshelf and thought of you. Mary Shelley wrote it on a dare when she was only 19. I know. She’s both my literary hero and nemesis, and I have two years and 364 days to beat her. Well, I think it’s very smart that you’re focusing on literary monsters, and leaving whatever real ones might be out there',\n",
              "  ' to the authorities. “No man chooses evil because it is evil.” “He only mistakes it for happiness, the good he seeks.” Mary Shelley wrote that line to describe people like Weems, who do bad things under the guise of protecting the greater good. Did she put you up to this? [scoffs] Encourage me to pursue other interests? No. But she will expel you if you continue to defy her. So you’re only looking out for my best interests? Always. I think we’re a lot alike. We aren’t. I don’t need your help or your pity. I already have a mother and a therapist. That’s enough torture, even for me.

That’s great. Um… When are you free? Pick me up outside the Nevermore gates at 8:00. Cut your lights. Uh… Wednesday? [Galpin] Ty? What did I tell you? Come on, bud, steer clear of Wednesday Addams. She’s the kind of girl who’s gonna get you hurt. Believe me, I know the type. Is that supposed to be about Mom? Of course not. That would require you to actually talk about her. [low, discomforting music playing] I can’t deal with this right now. I gotta get to the hospital. I gotta check on the mayor. Be home before curfew. Did you ever even love her? [poignant, melancholy music playing] More than you could ever know. [door closes] [quizzical music playing] I’ve been thinking about my less-than-enthusiastic response to your surprise soirée. And I must admit, I regret not showing my gratitude towards you more appropriately. You really mean it? Take the win, Enid. If only there were a way for us to get off campus and have a little birthday redo. Just two best friends. Too bad the school is on lockdown. Would you look at that full moon… Oh, how about I say I’m about to wolf out and get a pass to the lupin cages? And say you volunteered to lock me in. My deviousness has finally rubbed off on you.

[Tyler grunting] [Xavier] What happened to him? [Tyler winces softly] Thanks, Doc. [Enid] Not to make this about me, but I am having a full-blown panic attack now. We need to get back before Weems realizes we’ve been gone. What the hell happened? This was you, wasn’t it? Wait, Dad, please. I’m okay. Sheriff, I understand you’re upset, but I think you need to see something. It was all here. The… The… The body parts and the blue Cadillac, the altar, and the bedroom filled with fresh roses. Yeah, well, it’s all gone now. Somebody cleared this place out after we left. Listen, yesterday I told you all signs pointed to this house, and I was right. That your justification for almost getting my son and your friends killed? Huh? Now, you listen to me. From this point forward, you are forbidden from seeing Tyler, and you are forbidden from pursuing anything to do with this case, understood? [thunder rumbling] You directly violated my explicit order and left campus during a lockdown. Not to mention putting your peers and yourself in danger. Which is grounds for expulsion. I know. And you have every right to exercise that option. I do believe it would be a grave error on your part. [disbelieving scoff] I think contrition might be in order right now, Miss Addams. Not hubris. I’ll never apologize for trying to uncover a truth. [menacing music playing] [Weems] What is this? It’s a warning from Rowan. Is this why he tried to kill you? His mother drew it before she died.

Am I supposed to thank you? I already apologized. It’s over. Over? Tonight was the icing on the birthday cake you couldn’t even be bothered to cut. You’ll use anyone to get what you want, even if it means putting them in danger. We could have died tonight because of your stupid obsession. But we didn’t. And now I’m one step closer to solving this case. That is what is important. I’ve tried really, really, really hard to be your friend. Always put myself out there. Thought of your feelings. Told people, “I know she gives off serial killer vibes, but she’s just shy.” I never asked you to do that. You didn’t have to because that’s what friends do! They don’t have to be asked. The fact that you don’t know that says everything. You want to be alone, Wednesday? Be alone. [door slams] [restrained, morose music playing] [Wednesday] Goody warned I was destined to be alone.

Just to keep him on his toes. Of course. He filled me in on what’s been going on. Monsters, murder, mayhem. What fun! I told him I had a job in Boston, but I’d be checking up on you.

[Fester] You know, when you give me that death stare of disapproval, you remind me of your mother. Speaking of scary things, you know what kind of monster you’re dealing with? I haven’t been able to identify it. Ooh. [chilling music playing] It’s called a Hyde. As in Jekyll and Hyde? Mm-hmm. You’ve seen one before? Oh yeah. In ’83, during my vacay at the Zurich Institute for the Criminally Insane. Where I got my first lobotomy. But you know lobotomies. They’re like tattoos. Can’t just get one. Tell me about the Hyde. Ah. Olga Malacova. Jeez. She had it all. Beauty, brains, and a penchant for necrophilia. [Fester chuckles, claps] Olga was a concert pianist, until one night she transformed in the middle of a Chopin sonata. Massacred a dozen audience members. And three music critics. What triggered her? Or did she just change on her own? No idea. I only saw her in group electroshock therapy. There’s never been any mention of Hydes in any outcast book. And Nevermore is reputed for having the best collection. You try Nathaniel Faulkner’s diary? Mmm! Before he founded Nevermore, Faulkner traveled the world, cataloging every outcast community. How do you know this? You think your parents can’t keep their hands off each other now,\\xa0oy vey. I showed up unannounced one night in Gomez’s dorm room.

This is the third time in 24 hours you’ve forgotten something. So, how is everything going? Solitude suits me. With no annoying distractions, I’m almost finished with my novel. Was I an annoying distraction? You definitely had some annoying habits. Such as? You giggle when you text, which is a 24/7 addiction. At least it’s not a migraine-inducing typewriter hammering into my head. When not grinding your canines, you growl in your sleep. As opposed to late night cello solos? You over-commit to activities, then complain about them. I’d take that over your obsession with all things creepy. You could gas an entire village with the amount of perfume you spritz. That’s just off the top of my head. Guess I’m lucky with the new bestie that doesn’t try to find ways to endanger literally everybody she comes into contact with. In fact, Yoko and I are so in sync that she’s begging me to be her new roomie. Permanently. Don’t let me hold you back. Enjoy your solitude, Wednesday. It’s not solitude if you’re still here.

How’d you swing your own single? My former roommate couldn’t handle my toxic personality. [Fester] Mmm. Here it is. [suspenseful music playing] Faulkner describes Hydes as artists by nature, but equally vindictive in temperament. Born of mutation, the Hyde lays dormant until unleashed by a traumatic event or unlocked through chemical inducement or hypnosis. This causes the Hyde to develop an immediate bond with its liberator, who the creature now sees as its master. It becomes the willing instrument of whatever nefarious agenda this new master might propose. [Fester] Anyone willing to unlock a Hyde is a next-level sicko.

He wanted to determine if they were just mindless killers or conscious of their actions. What was his conclusion? He was killed by a Hyde before he could reach one. Others tried to carry on his research, but the Hydes were too unpredictable and violent. They were officially banned from Nevermore 30 years ago.

Never. More like evolving. Well, one inch of duct tape at a time. [poignant music playing] Why the sudden change of heart? Because we work. We shouldn’t, but we do. It’s like some sort of weird, friendship anomaly. Everything you said about me is true. But I don’t apologize for it. Not anymore. It’s just who I am. Thing said he missed you. I missed him too. I’m sorry about Xavier. I’m not. He’s a liar and a killer. Besides… there’s nothing quite like the feeling of being proven right. Except maybe someone to share it with. Thing may have blabbed about your date with Tyler. So how’d it go? It was interrupted. Well, I heard Tyler’s working the late shift… [Tyler] We’re closed. Then you should lock your doors. There’s some real sick people out there. Yeah, my dad told me what happened with Xavier. Pretty nuts. That guy always seemed so normal. You know, for an outcast. Well, you know, it has made me re-evaluate things. Like what? Like who I can trust. That mean you’re ready to be more than friends? [tender, emotional music playing] [Tyler chuckles] [eerie whooshing] Whoa, hey! [savage snarling] [clang] [claw slicing] [guttural growling] [heavy panting] You okay? I need to go. What?

              " ['Original release date: November\\xa023,\\xa02022 Wednesday and her classmates lure Tyler into the forest, where they kidnap him. Seeking a confession, Wednesday starts torturing Tyler. Disagreeing with her methods, her classmates alert Weems, and Wednesday is arrested. At the police station, Tyler finally confesses to being the monster. Fed up with Wednesday’s behavior, Weems expels her from Nevermore. Wednesday visits Eugene at the hospital, who tells her that the figure he saw at the monster’s cave wore red boots, matching Ms. Thornhill’s. Using her shapeshifting powers, Weems and Wednesday get Thornhill to confess her true identity—Laurel Gates. However, Gates is able to kill Weems and subdue Wednesday. Using Wednesday’s blood, Gates resurrects Crackstone and leaves Wednesday to die, but Goody appears to heal her. Enid, having finally transformed into her werewolf form, defeats Tyler in his Hyde form while Crackstone breaches Nevermore in his pursuit to destroy the school. With help from Bianca, Wednesday destroys Crackstone, and Eugene helps defeat Gates. Xavier is released from prison, Tyler is detained, and Wednesday departs Nevermore, which is closing for the remainder of the semester. * * * [low, menacing music playing] Thing gave me your note. I was surprised you wanted to see me again after you ran out the other night. So, uh, is\\xa0this a date? It’s a surprise. [wry chuckle] When I came to Nevermore, romance was the last thing on my mind. But when you kissed me, you opened my eyes and suddenly it all made sense. [confused scoff] Xavier warned me about you, but I didn’t listen. Ironic now, huh? Ironic would’ve been framing Xavier for murder while the real Hyde helped me put him away. Wait… you don’t think… I don’t think. I know. Kinbott probably discovered your secret during one of your sessions. So she unlocked you. Why’d you kill her? I thought Hydes were typically loyal to their masters. Wednesday, this is nuts. On Outreach Day, I told you I was visiting the old meeting house. [Hyde snarls] Did Kinbott send you to spy on me? At the Rave’N, you overheard Eugene and me discussing your cave in the woods and you warned Kinbott. Eugene probably saw her torching it. Then she sent you to clean up her mess. I have to hand it to you, Tyler. Wounding yourself that night at the Gates mansion, that was a masterstroke of misdirection. Okay, stop. Do you know how insane you sound right now? I’m not a monster. A… And if you really thought t',\n",
              "  'hat I was, why would you risk bringing me out to the woods to confront me alone? Who said I was alone? Okay, I don’t know what kind of sick joke you’re playing, but I’m out of here. Actually… you’re coming with us. [disconcerting audio distortions] [snaps] [tense, unnerving music playing] Welcome back. Where the hell am I? Somewhere no one can hear your screams. What’s with the chains? Don’t ask stupid questions. Wednesday, this is crazy. I’m a normie. That’s only half true. Do you recognize her? Perhaps if I hadn’t been so distracted by my own mother hogging this photo, I would have noticed yours sooner. Your father fell in love and married an outcast. [Tyler] My mom was an outcast. That doesn’t make me a monster. According to her personal medical records… You stole her medical records? Technically, Thing did. He took them from your garage. Your father’s quite the pack rat. Her postpartum depression triggered her condition. My mom had severe bipolar disorder. We both know that’s a lie. She was a\\xa0Hyde. And your father has been living his life in dread, never quite sure whether or not she passed her condition on to you. Are you all gonna stand there and let her do this to me? Uh, guys? Enid just texted. Thornhill’s suspicious. How long until he morphs into that… thing? I’m not the monster. You are. I saw it in a vision at the Weathervane. Wait, you’re basing all this off some vision you had after we kissed? I mean, is that something you can trust? [Bianca] Wednesday, what are you doing? Just some light torture. Don’t worry, I won’t leave a mark. [Bianca] Wednesday, hold on. [Ajax] Wait. Are you being serious? There’s only one thing that a Hyde understands. Pain. Wait! No, Wednesday! Wednesday! That’s it. I’m out! [Nightshade member] Us too. No. Wait. No, I’m done. Wednesday, I didn’t sign up for this. Let’s go to Weems, explain everything. Weems won’t help. And Tyler is always one step ahead of his father. Then you’re on your own. [Tyler panting] No, don’t leave me here with her, please! I’m begging you, please! [grim, foreboding music playing] [tasers sparking] [jauntily macabre music playing] [Kinbott] When I press him on his mother or any sensitive issue, he snaps, becoming cold and detached. It’s like I’m talking to a different person. I’m increasingly concerned. I believe the trauma of losing his mother may have left Tyler with deeper psychological scars than I suspected. [cell phone ringing] [Galpin] Hello? Sheriff Galpin.',\n",
              "  ' We have a problem. And her name is\\xa0Wednesday Addams. What is Kinbott, or should I say Laurel Gates, using you for? [weakly] Wednesday, please. Tyler, the body parts in the basement of the Gates mansion, what was she collecting them for? I don’t understand. Why are you doing this? [sirens wailing, approaching] Let’s test your reflexes. [Tyler] I’m in here! Get away from my son! Drop it. Drop it. [hammer clatters] [officer] Sign here. [indistinct police radio chatter] Sheriff Galpin isn’t pressing kidnapping charges. Which is a miracle given the circumstances. Of course not. How long have you known? Excuse me? When I gave you that claw from the cave, did you already know? Wednesday, that’s enough. [Galpin] Xavier Thorpe is our Hyde. We’ve got evidence, thanks to you. That’s why I’m giving you one pass. Tyler is going to turn on you too. Let’s go. Get out. We… Wednesday, wait. Tyler! No, no, what are you doing? I need to talk to her, Dad. She was my friend. We’re in a police station. What’s gonna happen? Make it quick. What do you want? To ask a question. What does it feel like? What does what feel like? To lose. [chilling music playing] You know, at first, I’d wake up naked, covered in blood, no idea what happened. But over time, I started to remember everything. The sound of their screams, the panic in their eyes, and a fear so primal I could taste it. And it was delicious. You have no idea what’s coming. [music swells, fades away] [barely restrained seething] The quid pro quo for Sheriff Galpin not pressing charges is your immediate expulsion from Nevermore. The others had nothing to do with this. I acted alone. For someone who claims to have no friends, you certainly protect them. They didn’t have guts to do what needed to be done. You mean kidnapping and torture? I should hope not. You do realize that Tyler brutally disemboweled six people, then harvested a variety of their body parts. Perhaps if you’d come to me with your suspicions rather than take matters into your own hands, we could’ve worked together. Because trust and cooperation have always been hallmarks of our relationship. [weary chuckle] [gloomy music playing] I admire your ability to be your own person and trust your own instincts. But that also makes you impatient and impulsive. Your actions have put me and the school in an impossible position. Tyler is the Hyde. And he has framed Xavier. He confessed everything to me! I wish I could believe you. His mother was',\n",
              "  ' an outcast. She was a student here, you must remember her. She was a Hyde! Yes, Francois. A lovely woman. I didn’t ask what she identified as. Then give me more time, and I can prove they are Hydes. There is no more time, and there are no more deals, Wednesday. Pack your steamer trunks. We will have them shipped. And say your goodbyes. You’ll be on the afternoon train tomorrow. I’m sorry Nevermore didn’t work out for you, Wednesday. I’m sure your mother will be very disappointed. And so am I. [lachrymose music playing] [Xavier sighs] Xavier… I’m not sure how much time we have. Thing distracted the guards and is looping the cameras. What are you doing here? I know you’re not the Hyde. Tyler used me to frame you. He is the actual Hyde. How do you know? I saw it in a vision when he kissed me. [suspenseful music playing] I’m… glad you were getting some action while I was falsely accused. I should’ve believed you. But since you seem to have some psychic connection to the Hyde, I was curious if you’ve drawn anything that might shed light on this? You want my help? You ruined my life! No. I tried being your friend. Look where that got me. This isn’t about us, Xavier. No, it’s about you! Every time you get involved, people get hurt. You’re toxic. All you ever do is make things worse. Tyler warned me something bad was coming. I think… I don’t care! Do you want to stop this? Then leave. Go far away and never come back. Do you understand? That can’t happen if you’re not here. That’s how you save everyone, okay? So, go. Leave! [disbelieving scoff] [tense music builds, fades away] [typewriter dings] [clasp locks] I can’t believe I’m actually going to miss your creepy, lifeless eyes waking me up. It won’t be the same without you. So I assume you’ll be moving in with Yoko. Leaving me in the past. Not ever. What about you? Will you forget about me? Enid… the mark you have left on me is indelible. Anytime I grow nauseous at the sight of a rainbow or hear a pop song that makes my ears bleed, I’ll think of you. [subdued, whimsical music playing] Thanks. I guess. I always believed relying on other people to be a sign of weakness. That inevitably they would lead me to disappointment. Turns out I’ve been the disappointment. Are you kidding me? I’ve learned so much from you. Part of it is admittedly criminal behavior, but… most people spend their entire lives pretending to give zero effs, and you literally never had an eff to give. Any chance you’ve',\n",
              "  ' got some sort of sneaky plan to elude Weems? Xavier’s right. This prophecy cannot come true if I’m not here. But it kills me to leave when Tyler is still walking around free. If he tries anything, we have a school full of gorgons, vampires, and werewolves, ready and waiting. We’ve got this,\\xa0Wednesday. I promise. On a good note, I got a text from Eugene’s moms. He woke up last night. Maybe Weems’ll let you drop by on your way to the station. [Thing snapping insistently] I think we’re all set. [Enid] Thing, I’m going to miss our makeup tutorials. And you better keep sending me moisturizing tips. Stay in touch, okay? So, we’re gonna… You’re right. Not hugging is kind of our\\xa0thing. [dramatic music playing] The plan wasn’t to get you expelled. We’re sorry. The Nightshades need to be ready for what’s coming. Or a lot of people are going to die. I’m so glad I caught you. I was weeding my wolfsbane, and I just completely lost track of time. This is a parting gift. White oleander, one of nature’s deadliest. It also symbolizes destiny and renewal. You’re a very talented young woman, Wednesday. I can’t wait to see what you do next. [Weems] Wednesday. This time I’m personally escorting you to your train. I have one final favor. [sighs] [Eugene] Wednesday! Eugene. Glad to see you’re finally awake. I heard you visited all the time. Don’t ever mention it again. [chuckles] Listen, I’ve been meaning to tell you… I shouldn’t have gone to the dance. I should have been with you. When the dance floor calls, you gotta answer. It’s not your fault. It’s the monster’s. It’s actually called a Hyde. It’s still out there. You can’t go back\\xa0to Nevermore. Not even to check on your bees. And you have to listen to me this time. I thought hummers were supposed to stick together. [somber music playing] That night in the woods, someone set fire to that cave. Yes, Dr. Kinbott. It’s so crazy that it was her. I don’t really remember any of it. I just saw someone wearing black and those boots. What about her boots? There was an explosion of light and just for a moment, I saw that they weren’t black. They were red. [sinister music building] [door closes] Wednesday. I thought you’d be halfway to New Jersey by now. You can drop the act, Laurel. I should have known it was you. Faking your death, securing a job at Nevermore, unlocking a\\xa0Hyde. Typically, I have great admiration for well-executed revenge plots. But yours was a bit extreme, even for my high standards. Oh, ',\n",
              "  'dear. Weems was right. You do need psychiatric help. Can’t throw out wild accusations without consequences. They may be wild… but they’re true. Tyler told me everything. Initially I incorrectly accused Kinbott of using hypnosis to unlock him. But you used a plant-derived chemical, didn’t you? [scoffs] [Wednesday] I know your father kept tabs on all the outcasts in town. So I assume he told you about the Galpin family secret when you were just a girl. That’s why you targeted Tyler. You manipulated him by showing him what his mother truly was. What Tyler didn’t realize is that truth wouldn’t free him. I’m so sorry. It would enslave him to you. That was scary at first, so you used the cave and the shackles. [chains rattling] But eventually he willingly became your servant. And when Kinbott came close to discovering the truth, you had Tyler kill her and pin it on Xavier. Ugh. That’s enough. Tyler, honey, make Mama happy and shut her up. Permanently. He’s not on your side. Tyler will do anything for me. Remember what I told you? I showed you who you really are. What they did to your mother… [whispering] The outcasts made you a monster. If you only hate outcasts, why is he killing normies as well? They’re just pawns in a bigger game. Just like you, Wednesday. Once again, you’ve underestimated the situation. You were never getting on that train. I sent Tyler to intercept you. I never made it to the station. Heard enough? [dramatic, revelatory music playing] Your slave is probably still at the station. Don’t make this more difficult than it already is, Marilyn. My name is Laurel! [sharp stinger] [suspenseful music builds] [grunting] [Weems gasping] [Wednesday] Principal Weems! Principal Weems! [Weems shuddering] [Weems exhales softly] Nightshade poisoning. [Laurel] A fitting end, don’t you think? [clang] [sinister music playing] [upbeat pop music playing faintly] [both chuckling] [claws rasp] Whoa. Are you okay? You’re not gonna, like, wolf out on me, are you? It is a full blood moon. I’m okay, I think. But this is helping. [“Flight of the Bumblebee” playing as ring tone] [Enid chuckles] [phone chimes] Hey! Eugene, how are you? Have you seen Wednesday? No, she left this afternoon. Didn’t she swing by to see you? Listen, Principal Weems and her went and confronted Ms. Thornhill. But I haven’t heard a peep from either of them. Why would they confront Ms. Thornhill? Because she’s behind everything that’s happened. She’s the bad guy… bad w',\n",
              "  'oman. She’s just a really bad person. Okay. Ajax and I will go check out the conservatory. Yo. Bee boy, welcome back. What’s he doing in your room? Um… [door opens] Wha…? [rousing music playing] Slow down! What happened? Principal Weems? What the hell is going on? What about Wednesday? Tyler and Thornhill took her? Where? Crackstone’s crypt, what the heck? Who are the Nightshades? I’ll… I’ll explain on the way. Come on. Guys. Guys? Calm down, Eugene. That gorgon is a moron. It… It could be dangerous. If Enid’s right, and Wednesday’s been taken, we need to call the sheriff. Mom, I’ve got to go. Wednesday’s my only friend, and if she’s in trouble, I’ve got to help. It’s hive code. [rousing music fades away] [Wednesday inhales groggily] [manacles clatter] [Wednesday seething] Kind of a déjà vu thing we got going on, huh? Except I won’t cry and whine like a child. [Laurel] Tyler, go wait by the boat. Yes. Listen to your master and be a good little Hyde. [jittery, creepy music playing] [Laurel] I have to admit… [door opens] …that shape-shifting stunt with Weems almost worked. [door closes] But as my father always said, “If you want to outsmart an outcast, you got to\\xa0out-think ’em.” You know, we have roots that go all the way back to Joseph Crackstone. So you come from a line of psychotic killers too. Joseph Crackstone was a visionary, dedicated to protecting normies from outcasts until his life was cut short by your ancestor, Goody Addams. And then, to add insult to injury, they stole his land to build that abomination of a school. But, throughout the centuries, my family has remained committed to Crackstone’s mission. My brother died serving that cause. I decided to take a different approach. The supernatural. Tyler’s been collecting these body parts to resurrect Crackstone. The one man who nearly succeeded in eradicating the outcasts. You can’t wake the dead. Believe me, I’ve tried. I believe your ancestor Goody Addams would disagree. Goody’s Book of Shadows. You’re the one that stole the original from Pilgrim World. It wasn’t enough for Goody to kill Crackstone. She had to curse his soul too. What does this have to do with me? My dear Wednesday, you are the key. Your arrival at Nevermore set the chubby wheels of my plan in motion. Goody sealed Crackstone in his sarcophagus with a blood lock. Only one of her direct descendants can open it. You are the key. A living descendant on the night of a blood moon. So… I bided my time, and ',\n",

Eugene Ottinger’s mom just called, frantic. Something’s going on at Nevermore. Get a couple cars over there ASAP. That’s just it, I can’t. The tires on the squad cars have been slashed.

I have summoned you to rid the world of outcasts once and for all. [chilling music playing] [Laurel gasps] My vengeance will be swift and true. As will mine. [arcane power pulses] Goody Addams. You haunt me still. You will suffer the same fate you bequeathed me. Now burn in the eternal fires of hell. [blade twists, flesh rends] [grunts] Where you belong. [grunting weakly] [Laurel] Sweet dreams, Wednesday! I can’t believe you’re in a secret society and you didn’t tell me. Because, you know, it’s secret. [Enid] Bianca, Davina… and Kent? Seriously, even Kent is here? How exclusive is this club? So, what’s the deal with Thornhill being a psycho? She murdered Weems and then took Wednesday to Crackstone’s crypt. We have to get everyone in the school to safety before it’s too late. [Ajax] This is what’s coming. [Kent] So do we pull the fire alarms? We don’t want to cause a panic and alert Tyler or Thornhill. So how do we get everyone out? We’ll use our siren song to convince them. Thing and I will go look for Wednesday. Okay, Nightshades forever. [all snap in unison] Seriously, a secret snap too? [ominous music playing] [faint voice] Wednesday. Are you here to take me to the other side? Listen, Crackstone must be stabbed through his black heart. It is the only way he will be vanquished now and forever. Is your spectral vision impaired? I’m dying. Your necklace. It is a powerful talisman. My mother told me it’s for conjuring visions. It is also a conduit for conjuring spirits. It will allow me to pass through you and heal you. Just know, once I do, you will never see me again. The school needs you, Wednesday.
